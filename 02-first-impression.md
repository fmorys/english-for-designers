## About me
Hey, I'm Filip. I've started toying around with graphic design in circa 2014. Since then I've been doing my best to try my hand at it in as many ways as possible. I believe that trying various approaches is the method that works the best for me - I've never really been focused on one single thing or style, therefore the more tools I try, the more I help myself to find out what is actually fun for me. It also "allows" me to combine several disciplines in a single project which I find is one of my favourite things to do. 

Eversince I moved to Prague I've been mainly focusing on brand identites, websites and also a little bit of motion design. In addition to that, I've been doing digital art as a hobby in my spare time.

Currently I'm finding my footing as a junior graphic designer at a gaming/esports-focused advertising agency. I think that videogames are an incredibly inspiring media precisely because of how much artistic talent and attention to detail goes into creating them, and even though videogame design is a completely different beast compared to advertising for videogames, I've been able to slowly find my way into learning Blender and doing some 3D work aswell.

I'd say that most of all, I find entertainment in worldbuilding. And I feel like that word encapsulates most of the work I do (or atleast the part which is really interesting for me). Be it a visual identity for a brand or a 3D environment, they both attempt to tell a complex story through visuals in an interesting way.

## Showcased projects

### Visual identities
[Hraj s námi!](https://www.morys.studio/portfolio-collections/my-portfolio/project-title-4-1-8de6e8-1)

Hraj s Námi! serves as a recruitment website for Eluvia, a company which provides IT solutions. The name directly translates to "Play with Us!" and the website mainly aims to provide info about the company and the team members. Since we're all supposed to "play together" in this context, I decided that a playing board figure would be the best element to use for the purposes of the website. I've used it as the basis for most of the 3D visuals on the website and we also have an ongoing arrangement - when there's a new employee joining the office, they can describe their playing board figure, pick which colors/accessories they like and I create that figure for use on the website.

[Kreativní Česko](https://www.morys.studio/portfolio-collections/my-portfolio/project-title-4-1)

Kreativní Česko (Creative Czechia) is a project managed by the Ministry of Culture, it covers communication platforms for creative industries. My work on the project included creating the visual identity (with an included brand guide) and designing a UI kit for the website. Currently the main website is still a WIP and my design is only used for the web portal for Creative vouchers (a financial tool to help support the cooperation of small and medium-sized enterprises and providers of creative services.

### 3D Work (mostly personal projects)
